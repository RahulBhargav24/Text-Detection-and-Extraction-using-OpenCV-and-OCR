# Text-Detection-and-Extraction-using-OpenCV-and-OCR
This project demonstrates how to detect and extract text from images using a combination of OpenCV for image preprocessing and Tesseract OCR for text recognition. It provides a complete workflow from loading an image to drawing bounding boxes around detected text, making it a solid foundation for applications like document digitization, license plate recognition, and automated data entry
